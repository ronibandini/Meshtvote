# Meshtvote
Simple decentralized decisions in a dystopian future

# Hardware
Heltec v3
ESP32 Firebeetle 2
BTW, you can use any other Meshtastic hardware and ESP32

Connect using 4 jumper cables: 
Heltec 3.3v -> VIN
Heltec GND -> GND
Heltec 5 -> 19
Heltec 4-> 20

Configure Serial Module pins 5 RX and 4 TX, Proto mode

# Software
Change default passwords and upload the ino to the ESP32 using Arduino IDE

# Start
Power up the Heltec and the Firebeetle will be powered as well. Now you can connect to Meshtvote AP to configure the voting or send DMs to the MeshtVote node with the password.
